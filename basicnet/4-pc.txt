as soon as you click on a video on a page, the pc generates a packet containing the request message, and sends it to
 the webpage (say www.youtube.com)
youtube will respond with many packets, let's say, pieces of the video, returning to your computer
this process youtube is doing: sending the video piece by piece, is called "STREAMING"

communicating in internet refers to sending packets through internet and receiving packets from internet

avoiding Single Point of Failure, youtube also has many servers distributed all around the world
the one that you normally connect, is the best suited server (location, response time, ...)
all servers have the same information. The youtube servers are called distributed servers
distributed servers prevent Single Point of Failure and provide Load Balancing
