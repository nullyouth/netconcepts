How a packet moves over the internet?

PCa wants to send a packet to PCb
    PCa sends the packet to the switch
    LANa switch looks the packet destination address
    switch-a sends packet to the router-a
    router-a looks the packet contents and learns it destination and understands that it must send it to a different
     network LAN -> LANb
    router-a sends the packet through the ISP cable (this cable communicates LANa to the internet), to another router:
     router-x
    router-x receives the packet through one of its ports
    that router-x has many options to decide: to which router I must send the packet to reach its destination as fast
     as possible?
        Each router must have a special table inside called 'Routing Table' -> this table tells us which route the
         packet should use
    so, router-x will look al the Routing Table to learn which path it must send the packet according to the
     information on the Routing Table -> we call this operation 'Forwarding'
    Forwarding happens on each router, each router has a Routing Table
    the Routing Table is created by the router's hardware by using special algorithms
    while making the Forwarding decision, the router ignores the path which the packet came from (it makes no sense
     sending the packet back to where it came from)
    the same process will occur every time at each router the packet reaches until the packet reaches LANb
    if a path were to busy (too many packets are traveling) the router will not send the packet over that path
    the packet reaches LANb arriving at router-b
    router-b sends packet to switch-b
    switch-b redirects packet through PCb's port
    the packet sent from PCa has reached its destination (all this process happening in a few milliseconds)

INTERNET IS THE NETWORK OF NETWORKS

The combination of all LANs connected to ISPs make internet. The combination of all LANs is the internet
