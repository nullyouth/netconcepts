SWITCH ( and WAP ) and LAN

Switch device if we want computers in the same environment to communicate with each other
Then connect them to the switch through cables, generally CAT-5 || CAT-6 copper cables (copper conductors)
Cat-6 are faster than Cat-5
Cat => Category
Some switches support fiber optic cables
A switch cannot use wireless technology

You should use an Access Point device if you want computers in the same environment to communicate wirelessly
Named WAP (Wireless Access Point) or AP

This communication in the same environment is known as Local Area Network (LAN)
All houses in the world are actually LANs

The message sent from one computer to another: packet (or frame)
PCa sends packet to PCb:
    packet goes from PCa to the switch
    switch looks at the inside of the packet for the destination
    switch sends packet to PCb

A switch has various numbers of ports -> LAN ports where you connect the cables
LAN ports are also in our computers

The packet travels from one computer to another:
    packet goes to the switch through the cable
    the switch port gives the packet to the switch hardware
    the hardware looks inside the packet to learn its destination
    the hardware gives the packet to the destination switch port
    the switch sends the packet to the desired destination PC and the packet travels very cozy and peaceful to the
     destination pc's port
