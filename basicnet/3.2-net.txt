internet is communicated through underwater cables placed in different continents. Internet has a distributed structure
This avoids the Single Point of Failure problem
There are ~468 underwater cables, these are the most important part of the internet today
Some are 131 km long, some are 20k km long...
Breaking one of this cables can cause the internet to crash down in a whole continent
Almost 200 problems occur each year with these cables and the problems are substantially related to ships and natural
 disasters
In 2007 some sea pirates stole an 11 km long cable that was connecting Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. They sold this
 long cable as scrap by dividing it into parts
There are also intercontinental cables connecting countries through land
All underwater cables are fiber optic cables
They've chosen to use fiber optic because one disadvantage of copper is that as long the distance is, the more
 probability to have errors in data transmission. Fiber optic cables have less error chances on long distances
