WIDE AREA NETWORK ( WAN )

a network consisting of a combination of different LANs
thanks to WAN, we can ensure that LANs located in different places around the world can communicate as if they were in
 the same LAN environment

some companies use WAN technology to communicate their distributed offices

thank's to the internet, we can already communicate two (or more) LANs
then why we would need a WAN in the first place?
internet is a public network, any person can connect to it, wherever and whenever they want

there are many methods to set up a WAN, one of them is via VPN, because VPNs provides us with tunneling technology
 (creating a special network connection over a public network) --- i don't know if tunneling works like this
tunneling technology makes the packet act as if it's going through a physical tunnel between two routers

(analogy)
through the public network:
    if you want to send a letter from house-a to house-b, the postman could see the letter contents
with tunneling:
    the letter would be enveloped and the postman couldn't see its contents (-> ENCAPSULATION)
    even though we increased the security, there will still be vulnerabilities
    so the letter must be encrypted in order to have the maximum security (-> ENCRYPTION)

however, any system has vulnerabilities...

with this VPN technology we can look at a basic WAN example
PCa (from LANa) needs to send packet to PCb (on LANb):
    packet flows from PCa to router-a
    some changes will occur to the packet:
        1st encryption
        2nd encapsulation
        with this, the tunnel is set up
    packet travels through internet
    packet reaches router-b
    (DECAPSULATION process) -> take the original packet out of the tunnel --- idk if this happens at router-b or where
     exactly,,, prob i have to read about tunneling and VPNs to have more understanding
        wrapper packet is removed
        encrypted packet is decrypted
    router-b looks at the packet content and learns its destination
    packet reaches PCb

END TO END ENCRYPTION helps to protect the packets sent from our PC to another place (and vice versa) by being
 permanently encrypted while traveling. Only the endpoints can decrypt the packet to obtain the original data
