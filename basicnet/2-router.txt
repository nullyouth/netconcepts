ROUTER COMMUNICATES YOU WITH INTERNET

A router enables a computer to communicate to the internet
In order to perform this task, the router must be connected to the switch device by a copper cable
A special cable from outside our house connects to our router. The cable is provided by our ISP
So basically the router delivers the packets from the LAN to the internet

PC sends packet to internet (the computer can communicate with internet):
    sends packet to switch
    switch looks the packet and understands that it wants to go to the internet
    sends the packet to the router
    router looks at the inside of the packet and understands that it wants to go to the internet
    sends the packet through the ISP cable

(the router has ports also (where you connect the cables))
