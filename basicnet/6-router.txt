we have 2 offices that belong to the same office separated by a distance of 100 mts (short)
we can connect switch-1 to switch-2 to create a LAN. We can create a LAN by connecting 2 switches that are at a short
 distance away from the other
this types of LANs are called Campus Area Networks (CAN) <- a special type of LAN. Used on universities

but, which one is more secure? WAN with VPN or LAN created by connecting switches together?
LAN is more secure because in the communication within the LAN, the packet never passes over the internet, the packet
 always moves on our own cable

there is a WAN that could be more secure than a LAN: a private WAN
the line between the offices is dedicated for the company. The line is provided by the ISP. ISP WAN Network
making a private WAN can be quite costly, especially over long distances

we use switch devices to create LANs, and we use routers to create WANs

the main task of a router is to connect different networks
