internet service provider

responsible of the transmission of packets between locations
each isp controls specific routers
local isps are responsible for small area communications

house 3 connects to a local isp PoP (Point of Presence). This PoP is the first point to be able to connect to the
 internet for this home
that is how local isps connect different neighbourhoods

different local isps connect over regional isps
    local isp 1 and local isp 2 communicate through regional isp 1
    local isps connect neighbourhoods and regional isps connect cities in a country

global isps connect devices in different countries

a local isp could be connected directly to a global isp that could make that local isp to access the global internet
 fastly

let's say we're in house 3 and want to connect to abcx.com
our request message must pass over at least one global isp
abcx.com will create the response message

if we for example wanted to communicate with google.com...
large companies want to communicate with customers as fast as possible, so they have distributed servers all around
thanks to the proximity of google's server, the response time is low. However, they increase the response time with
 PEERING

peering is the technique which google establishes a connection with an isp to provide faster access to each server
due to the direct connection, the packet passes through much less PoPs
that's why watching videos in other platforms (other than youtube) take less speed. For example, udemy, it doesn't use
 peering

the network composed by each other set-up global isps is called INTERNET BACKBONE

    #                               #
    #-------------------------------#

    internet exchange points work in order to make the internet backbone to work synchrounously and for global isps to
     with one another more efficiently

you don't have to connect to a local isp in order to connect to the internet. you could connect to a regional/global
 isp if these had a service for your location
