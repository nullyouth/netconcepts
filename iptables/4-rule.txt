within a particular chain, we're are going to have rules ( firewall rules )
user-defined commands that manipulate the network traffic
rules e.g.: 
    - i wan't you to block any ssh incoming connection ( INPUT chain ? )
    - block http connections ( INPUT chain ? )

the packet will be tested against each of these rules secuentially from the top to the bottom
e.g.: if we have a packet coming in, and it's requesting an ssh connection, it is going to be tested against each rule
 until it matches a valid rule. If it matches, a target is going to be set
