the term target refers to what is going to happen to a particular packet once it has matched a particular rule

available targets:
    ACCEPT
        stop processing and allow the packet to flow into the service that it was intended to
        ACCEPT ssh connections -> allow the packet to travel into the ssh service

    REJECT
        drop the packet and send feedback to the user

    DROP
        drop the packet with no feedback, like if the packet wasn't ever even sent to the system

if a packet comes into the system and there's no firewall rule that matches that specific packet, it will use the
 default polices or the default rule that we created. If there's no default rule, the packet will simply be accepted by
 the system
