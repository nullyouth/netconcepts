a table within iptables is a collection of chains that serves a particular function
responsible for doing or handling certain aspect of networking

unique pieces of networking's functionality are separated in form of tables

there are 5 tables in iptables:
    (( 3 main tables -- the first 3 mentioned below ))
    each table has different rules that can be applied to them

    1st FILTER (( default -- main ))
        filtering ingoing and outgoing traffic -> let or not a packet continue to its destination
        sometimes if you don't specify the table, the rule will apply to FILTER

    2nd NAT
        provides Network Address Translation rules to determine how to modify the packet source and destination address

    3rd MANGLE
        modifying packets
        modifying ip headers of the packet

    (( non-main tables below ))

    4th RAW

    5th SECURITY
