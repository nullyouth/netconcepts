tags that define and match packets to the estate
chains are like points in the route of a packet where you can apply rules

5 chains in iptables: PREROUTING, INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING
all chains are not available for all tables

FILTER: INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT

NAT:    PREROUTING, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING

MANGLE: PREROUTING, INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING

each chain is responsible for processing packets based on their type
packets being sent into the target will be processed by the INPUT chain, packets sent out of the system will be
 processed by the OUTPUT chain, packets forwarded from your computer to another computer using your computer will be
 processed by the FORWARD

PREROUTING:
    applies to any incoming packet after entering the network stack
    applies before any routing decisions regarding where to send the packet
    used after the packet has entered the network interface

INPUT:
    is a point post-PREROUTING
    when the packet enters the system
    used to incoming packets and connections to a particular service or protocol

FORWARD:
    applied to a packet that is forwarded through your system
    used to forward incoming packets from their source to their destination
    if the packet is sent to you and the destination is not set to your ip, forwarding takes place, so the FORWARD
     is responsible for managing that

OUTPUT:
    applied to a packet originated from your system and going out
    used for outgoing packets after they have been created or processed

POSTROUTING:
    opposite of PREROUTING
    applied to outgoing or forwarded traffic after the routing decision takes place
    used before the packet leaves the network interface, after the destination has been decided

packets transversal order:
    incoming packets destined for the local system: PREROUTING -> INPUT
    incoming packets destined to another host: PREROUTING -> FORWARD -> POSTROUTING
    locally generated packets: OUTPUT -> POSTROUTING
